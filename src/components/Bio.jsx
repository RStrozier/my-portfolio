                Hey there! I'm Rashida, a <i>self-taught developer</i>
                <br />
                with a passion for pushing the boundaries of reality. 
                Currently, I'm venturing into the realms of virtual reality
                and augmented reality. When I'm not conjuring digital
               experiences, I explore the world's hidden gems &
                reading books. My interests span beyond code,
            encompassing the worlds of botany, history, and deep thinking. 
                <br />

                <br /><b>Welcome to my captivating portfolio </b>
                <br />showcasing the mind-bending creations of my imaginative
                journey into virtual and augmented realities.
                Let's embark to discover where the lines
               are between what's real and what's possible.
                <br /><u>Than let's blur those lines in the most wondrous ways.</u>
