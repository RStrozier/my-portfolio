                Hey there! I'm Rashida, a self-taught web developer
                <br />
                with a passion for pushing the boundaries of reality. 
                <br />
                <br />Currently, my magical powers are channeled into the
                <br />realms  of virtual reality and augmented reality. 
                <br />When I'm not conjuring digital experiences, I explore
                <br />the world's hidden gems & read captivating books. 
                <br />My interests span beyond code, encompassing the
                <br />fascinating worlds of botany, history, and deep thinking. 
                <br />

                <br />journey into virtual and augmented realities.
